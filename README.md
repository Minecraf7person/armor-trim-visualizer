simple visualizer for minecraft armor trims made in godot 4

# probably the worst way to make a website
but atleast there arent any ads (not naming another site, but my friends were forced to use it until now)

it dont work on playstation but it works on xbox

the little guy follows your cursor which is pretty cool (he spins too)

includes a small wiki for them like where they are found and how to craft/dupe them

easy sharing of your combos using a link

might make a user sumbission gallery if i ever figure out a good way to do it, you know for combos incase you're unoriginal
